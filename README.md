Dockerized Laravel 5
==================

This a version of the Laravel 5.0 framework with additions to allow it to be run using Docker. This removes the hassle of deploying your webserver in a way the Laravel framework needs.

## Getting Started.
* Navigate within the project folder and run `composer update`.
* Now navigate into the `docker` directory (inside /project) and then run `bash build.sh` to build the container.
* Run the container with the command `bash run-container.sh`

## Licensing
The Laravel framework already uses the MIT licence, and all of my contributions are under the MIT licence as well.

Enjoy!
